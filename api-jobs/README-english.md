## API-JOBS

This service is part of the implementation of the 'backend challenge' solution, being the main service of the implemented architecture

![arquitetura](https://github.com/matheusgit1/backend-developer-test/blob/Matheus_Alves_Pereira/assets/architecture.png)

This service is responsible for the main CRUD operations regarding jobs

# Preparation

to run in a local environment it is necessary

- nodejs installed in version 20
- typescript
- insomnia for http requests (optional)
- postman for http requests (optional)
- docker (optional)

For local execution directly in the terminal, use the command below:

in development mode:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

or

```bash
yarn start:dev
```

em produÃ§Ã£o:

```bash
npm run build && npm run start
```

or

```bash
yarn build && npm run start
```

if you want to run a docker container:

```bash
docker build -t api-jobs .
```

and finally

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 --name api-jobs api-jobs
```

**important: ** configure the environment variables according to the .env.example file

the variables ``URL_HANDLER_EVENTS`` and ``HANDLER_EVENTS_X_API_KEY`` are obtained with the deployment of the handler-eventos service

## Stacks

Typescript, JavaScript, Shell, Jest, autocannon

## Unit testing

To run unit tests, use the command lines below

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

or

```bash
npm run test
```

or

```bash
yarn test:coverage
```

or

```bash
yarn test

```

**Important:** many tests were implemented, guarantee computational resources to execute general tests, otherwise run each isolated test as stated in the scripts in package.json

```bash
npm run test:usecase or\
npm run test:usecase:coverage or\
npm run test:modules or\
npm run test:modules:coverage or\
npm run test:controllers or\
npm run test:controllers:coverage
```

## Load test (simulated)

This service includes simulated load testing with autocannon, which can be adapted to a real scenario.

To run the load test with the fixed default configurations, run the commands below:

```bash
npm run autocannon:server
```

This will upload a mocked application for load testing

To run the test, run the command below:

```bash
npm run autocannon:test
```

The standard test lasts 10 seconds, simulates 300 simultaneous connections, and operates with all processing cores

*these variables and values can be changed in  ./src/@autocannon/test*

done this. A final test report is displayed:

![relatÃ³rio](https://github.com/matheusgit1/backend-developer-test/blob/Matheus_Alves_Pereira/assets/load-test-with-autocannon.png)

**important: ** in this example we have a heavier simulated scenario with high latency

to change this parameter change the variable latencia in ./src/@autocannon/server/routes.ts
