# Handler eventos

This service is part of the "back-end developer challenge"

The central objective of this service is to receive via http the publication of events issued by other services that emit some type of event to be handled by another service

example:

An action cannot be completed immediately, but it cannot prevent another from happening.

A use case within the service is:
When a job is published, it cannot be published immediately, nor can the client wait for a return while stuck in "loading"

for this, from outside asynchronously, the event is emitted and captured by the event-handler and handled

as the architecture below indicates:

![Arquitetura](https://github.com/matheusgit1/backend-developer-test/blob/Matheus_Alves_Pereira/assets/handler-events.png)

Below are some considerations before we test the application in your own environment, read them carefully.

## Initial considerations

As it is a serverless application, local validation must be done via unit testing, and load testing is unfeasible in this scenario.

Before proceeding to your AWS dashboard, create the following path in SSM

```bash
/develop/handler-eventos/api-key
```

add a value, it will be the api key (x-api-key).

modify the ``values.yml`` file with the account, subnets and security group id configurations.

**otherwise deploy will not be executed**

To make this service available in your AWS environment, run the commands below:

```bash
serverless config credentials --provider aws --key YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE --secret YOUR_SECRET_KEY_GOES_HERE --overwrite
```

And finally:

```bash
serverless deploy
```

**If you are doing this in an IAM account, don't forget to give the account resource access permission**

- cloudFormation
- cloudWatch
- lambda
- sns
- sqs
- ec2
- roles
- s3

... and others as necessary.

after deployment, in the aws console, retrieve the values of the api key and the generated endpoint, they will be variables of ``api-job``, as described in its documentation

## Stack utilizada
